Escc.Cms.IdentifyUnusedResources
================================

A tool to identify resources in the Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 Resource Manager which are not used on any pages.
Most of the work is done by a tool writeen by Stefan Goﬂner of Microsoft. This project takes the report generated by that tool, 
extracts just the unused resources and emails them to an address specified on the command line.

Usage:

Customise Escc.Cms.IdentifyUnusedResources.bat with your own folder and filenames and email address, then run it.

Stefan Goﬂner's original tool is now available as a DLL version, which would eliminate the need to run a separate batch file.
