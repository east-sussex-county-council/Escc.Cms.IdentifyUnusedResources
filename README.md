Escc.Cms.IdentifyUnusedResources
================================

A tool to identify resources in the Microsoft Content Management Server 2002 Resource Manager which are not used on any pages.
Most of the work is done by a Microsoft tool released free-of-charge on the now-defunct GotDotNet website. This project takes
the report generated by that tool, extracts just the unused resources and emails them to an address specified on the command line.

Usage:

Customise Escc.Cms.IdentifyUnusedResources.bat with your own folder and filenames and email address, then run it.
